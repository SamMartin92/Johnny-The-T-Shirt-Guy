# Johnny the T-Shirt Guy

## Objective
My objective in this project is to build and deploy a static front end application for my first milestone project for the Code Institute using HTML & CSS. The 'client' in for the purpose of this project is my brother-in-law Johnny who designs and prints t-shirts & accessories. 

The Johnny The T-Shirt Guy website is an online store for the small business Johnny the T-Shirt Guy. It is a simple site which allows users to gain awareness of the business, view and order products & make enquiries with Johnny. I have laid out the user experience design below:

## Strategy:<ul>
<li>Build an e e-commerce site to promote the Johnny the T-Shirt Guy business and sell products.</li>
<li>Showcase the products, ethos & capablilites of the business to users.</li>
<li>Provide point of contact for users to generate business & grow customer base.</li>
</ul>

## Scope: <ul>
<li>Build a simple static website with a landing page including a blurb on Johnny The T-Shirt Guy describing the purpose of the site to users.</li>
<li>Provide a store page to advertise existing designs and previous personalised works.</li>
<li>Allow users to easily make orders and submit requests to the business.</li>
</ul>

## Structure: <ul>
<li>Build a simple site with linear design including a Home Page, Store page and Orders page.</li>
<li>Include a consistent navigation bar on each page</li>
<li>Include anchor tags in text of Home and Store pages to encourage users to navigate to order form</li>
</ul>

## Skeleton: <ul>
<li>Simple static layout to clearly display text & product images</li>
<li>Before beginning, I built the basic structure of the project in a practice https://github.com/SamMartin92/practice-for-first-project
